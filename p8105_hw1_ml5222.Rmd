I first load the required packages 
```{r loading, message=FALSE}
library(palmerpenguins)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Problem 1

First let's load in the data set 
```{r}
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
penguins

```

This data set is made up of `r nrow(penguins)` rows and `r ncol(penguins)` columns. The `r ncol(penguins)` variables are `r colnames(penguins)`. Species, island, and sex are factors, bill_length_mm and bill_depth_mm are numeric and flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g and year are integers. The mean bill depth is `r mean(penguins$bill_depth_mm,na.rm =TRUE)`. The mean bill length is `r mean(penguins$bill_length_mm,na.rm =TRUE)`. The mean flipper length is `r mean(penguins$flipper_length_mm,na.rm =TRUE)`.The mean body mass is `r mean(penguins$body_mass_g,na.rm =TRUE)`

```{r}
ggplot(penguins,aes(x=bill_length_mm,y=flipper_length_mm),)+geom_point()

```
