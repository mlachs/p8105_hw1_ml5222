I first load the required packages 
```{r cars}
library(palmerpenguins)
```

## Problem 1

First let's load in the data set 
```{r}
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
penguins
```

This data set is made up of `r nrow(penguins)` rows and `r ncol(penguins)` columns. The `r ncol(penguins)` variables are `r colnames(penguins)`. Species, island, and sex are factors, bill_length_mm and bill_depth_mm are numeric and flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g and year are integers.
