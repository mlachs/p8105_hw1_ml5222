I first load the required packages

``` r
library(palmerpenguins)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Problem 1

First let’s load in the data set

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
penguins
```

    ##  8 Adelie  Torgersen           39.2          19.6               195        4675

    ## # ℹ 334 more rows
    ## # ℹ 2 more variables: sex <fct>, year <int>

This data set is made up of 344 rows and 8 columns. There are some
values of NA within the data. The 8 variables are species, island,
bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, sex,
year. Species, island, and sex are factors, bill_length_mm and
bill_depth_mm are numeric and flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g and year
are integers. The mean bill depth is 17.1511696. The mean bill length is
43.9219298. The mean flipper length is 200.9152047.The mean body mass is
4201.754386

Let’s take a look at the relationship between flipper length and bill
length by species.

``` r
ggplot(penguins,aes(x=bill_length_mm,y=flipper_length_mm, colour = species))+geom_point()
```

There seems to be a relationship, let’s save this plot for future use.

``` r
ggsave(filename='flipper_bill_scatter.png')
```

## Problem 2

Let’s create a data frame

``` r
hw_df = tibble(
  rand_samp = rnorm(10),
  grt_0 = rand_samp>0,
  char_var= c('a','b','c','d','e','f','g','h','i','j'),
  fact_var= factor(c("A","B","O","A","A","B","B","A","O","A"))
  )
```

Lets get the mean of the random sample

``` r
mean(pull(hw_df,rand_samp))
```

    ## [1] -0.5711968

Lets try to get the mean of the logical vector

``` r
mean(pull(hw_df,grt_0))
```

    ## [1] 0.3

Lets try to get the mean of the character vector

``` r
mean(pull(hw_df,char_var))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(hw_df, char_var)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

Lets try to get the mean of the factor

``` r
mean(pull(hw_df,fact_var))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(hw_df, fact_var)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

It looks like only numeric and logical inputs work with mean function

Let’s try converting the non-numeric vectors

``` r
as.numeric(pull(hw_df,grt_0))
as.numeric(pull(hw_df,char_var))
as.numeric(pull(hw_df,fact_var))
```

While logical and factor vectors were able to be converted, the
character vector just returned NAs. This helps explain why the logical
vector was able to be used as a mean. The character vector could not be
easily converted and therefore had no values to calculate.

``` r
fact_var_test= factor(c(1,1,1,2,3,3,1,1,2,3))
mean(fact_var_test)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(fact_var_test): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA

Even when the factor is converted to numbers the mean can’t be found.
This is because they are not really numbers but categories in which the
values fall. You could think of the values as the word “one” instead of
the actual numeric value.
